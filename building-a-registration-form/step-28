<!-- Currently users can submit the form without checking the radio inputs. Although you previously used the required attribute to indicate that an input is required, it won't work in this case because adding required to both inputs will convey the wrong information to users.

To solve this, you can provide context of what is needed by adding a legend element with text Account type (required) before the label elements within the second fieldset. Then add the checked attribute to the Personal input to ensure the form is submitted with the required data in it. -->

      <fieldset>

<legend>Account type (required)</legend>
        <label><input type="radio" name="account-type" checked /> Personal</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="account-type" /> Business</label>
      </fieldset>
