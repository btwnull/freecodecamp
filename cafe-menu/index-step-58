<!-- Step 58
It is a bit boring for all the text to have the same font-family. You can still have the majority of the text sans-serif and make just the h1 and h2 elements different using a different selector.

Style both the h1 and the h2 elements using a single selector so that these elements' text use Impact font. -->

h1,h2 {
font-family:impact;
}
