<!-- Step 36
The action attribute indicates where form data should be sent.

Here is an example of a form element with an action attribute:

Example Code
<form action="/submit-url"></form>
In the example, action="/submit-url" tells the browser that the form data should be sent to the path /submit-url.

Add an action attribute with the value https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo to the form element. -->

       <form
          action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
        </form>
