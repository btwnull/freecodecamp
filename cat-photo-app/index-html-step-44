You can use radio buttons for questions where you want only one answer out of multiple options.

Here is an example of a radio button with the option of cat:

Example Code
<input type="radio"> cat
Remember that input elements are self-closing.

Before the text input, add a radio button with the option set as:

Indoor -->

 <input type="radio"> Indoor
          <input type="text" name="catphotourl" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
