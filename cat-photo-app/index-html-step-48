<!-- Step 48
Notice that both radio buttons can be selected at the same time. To make it so selecting one radio button automatically deselects the other, both buttons must have a name attribute with the same value.

Here is an example of two radio buttons with the same name attribute:

Example Code
<input type="radio" name="meal"> Breakfast
<input type="radio" name="meal"> Lunch
Add the name attribute with the value indoor-outdoor to both radio buttons. -->

<label><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" />Indoor</label>
<label><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" /> Outdoor</label>
