<!-- Step 65
Notice that everything you've added to the page so far is inside the body element. All page content elements that should be rendered to the page go inside the body element. However, other important information goes inside the head element.

The head element is used to contain metadata about the document, such as its title, links to stylesheets, and scripts. Metadata is information about the page that isn't displayed directly on the page.

Add a head element above the body element. -->
