<!-- Step 69
You can set browser behavior by adding self-closing meta elements in the head. Here's an example:

Example Code
<meta attribute="value">
Inside the head element, nest a meta element with an attribute named charset. Set to the value to utf-8 which tells the browser how to encode characters for the page.

Note that meta elements are self-closing.

With that last change, you have completed the Cat Photo App project. Congratulations! -->

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <title>CatPhotoApp</title>
</head>
