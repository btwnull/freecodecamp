<!-- Step 11
It's time to add some color to the marker. Remember that one way to add color to an element is to use a color keyword like black, cyan, or yellow.

As a reminder, here's how to target the class freecodecamp:

Example Code
.freecodecamp {

}
Create a new CSS rule that targets the class marker, and set its background-color property to red.

Note: You will not see any changes after adding the CSS. -->

.marker {
background-color: red;
}
