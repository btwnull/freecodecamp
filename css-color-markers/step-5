<!-- Step 5
You can have multiple self-closing meta elements on a web page. Each meta element adds information about the page that cannot be expressed by other HTML elements.

Add another self-closing meta element within the head. Give it a name attribute set to viewport and a content attribute set to width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0 so your page looks the same on all devices. -->

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <title>Colored Markers</title>
</head>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
