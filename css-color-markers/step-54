<!-- Color-stops allow you to fine-tune where colors are placed along the gradient line. They are a length unit like px or percentages that follow a color in the linear-gradient function.

For example, in this red-black gradient, the transition from red to black takes place at the 90% point along the gradient line, so red takes up most of the available space:

Example Code
linear-gradient(90deg, red 90%, black);
In the linear-gradient function, add a 75% color stop after the first red color argument. Do not add color stops to the other colors arguments. -->

.red {
background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgb(255, 0, 0) 75%, rgb(0, 255, 0), rgb(0, 0, 255));
}
