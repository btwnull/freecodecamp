<!-- Step 7
In this project you'll work with an external CSS file to style the page. We've already created a styles.css file for you. But before you can use it, you'll need to link it to the page.

Nest a link element within the head element. Give it a rel attribute set to stylesheet and an href attribute set to styles.css. -->

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>Colored Markers</title>
</head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
