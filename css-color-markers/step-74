<!-- Another way to set the opacity for an element is with the alpha channel. Similar to the opacity property, the alpha channel controls how transparent or opaque a color is.

You've already set sleeve's opacity with a named color and the opacity property, but you can add an alpha channel to the other CSS color properties.

Inside the .sleeve rule, remove the opacity property and value. -->

.sleeve {
width: 110px;
height: 25px;
background-color: white;
}
