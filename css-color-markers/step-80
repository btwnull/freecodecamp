<!-- Borders have several styles to choose from. You can make your border a solid line, but you can also use a dashed or dotted line if you prefer. Solid border lines are probably the most common.

In the .sleeve CSS rule, add the border-left-style property with the value solid. -->

.sleeve {
width: 110px;
height: 25px;
background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
border-left-width: 10px;
border-left-style: solid;
}
