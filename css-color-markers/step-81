<!-- Your border should be visible now. If no color is set, black is used by default.

But to make your code more readable, it's better to set the border color explicitly.

In the .sleeve CSS rule, add the border-left-color property with the value black. -->

.sleeve {
width: 110px;
height: 25px;
background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
border-left-width: 10px;
border-left-style: solid;
border-left-color: black;
}
