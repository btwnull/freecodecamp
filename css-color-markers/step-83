<!-- Your marker is looking good. But to make it look even more realistic, you can change the border style to double solid borders.

For the border-left shorthand property, change the border style value from solid to double. -->

width: 110px;
height: 25px;
background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
