<!-- The black color of your border looks pretty harsh against the more transparent sleeve. You can use an alpha channel to lower the opacity of the black border.

For the border-left shorthand property, use the rgba function to set the color value to pure black with 75% opacity. -->

.sleeve {
width: 110px;
height: 25px;
background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
border-left: 10px double rgba(0,0,0,0.75);
