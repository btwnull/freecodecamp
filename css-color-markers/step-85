<!-- Awesome. Your red marker is looking good. Now all you need to do is add the caps and sleeves to your other markers.

Add a cap and sleeve to both the green and blue markers. You can just copy the div elements from the red marker and paste them into the other two markers. -->

      <div class="marker red">
        <div class="cap"></div>
        <div class="sleeve"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="marker green">
                <div class="cap"></div>
        <div class="sleeve"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="marker blue">
                <div class="cap"></div>
        <div class="sleeve"></div>
      </div>
