<!-- Now that you're familiar with the box-shadow property you can finalize the shadows, starting with the one for the red marker.

In the .red CSS rule, update the values for the box-shadow property so offsetX is 0,offsetY is 0, blurRadius is 20px, spreadRadius is 0, and color is red. Remember that you don't need to add units to a zero value. -->

.red {
background: linear-gradient(rgb(122, 74, 14), rgb(245, 62, 113), rgb(162, 27, 27));
box-shadow: 0 0 20px 0 red;
}
