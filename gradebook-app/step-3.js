// The teacher is really happy with the program you have created so far. But now they want to have an easy way to check if a student has a passing grade. A passing grade is anything that is not an "F".

// Complete the function hasPassingGrade that takes a student score as a parameter. Your function should return true if the student has a passing grade and false if they do not.

// Tips

// Use the getGrade function to get the student's grade. Then check if the grade is passing or not.

return score > 59;
