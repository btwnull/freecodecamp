The code for an ordered list (ol) is similar to an unordered list, but list items in an ordered list are numbered when displayed.

flea treatment thunder other cats -->

        <h3>Top 3 things cats hate:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>flea treatment</li>
          <li>thunder</li>
          <li>other cats</li>
          </ol>
