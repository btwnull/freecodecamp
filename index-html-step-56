<!-- Step 56
There's another way to associate an input element's text with the element itself. You can nest the text within a label element and add a for attribute with the same value as the input element's id attribute.

Here is an example of using the for attribute to associate a label with an input element:

Example Code
<label for="breakfast"> Breakfast </label>
<input id="breakfast" type="radio" name="meal" value="breakfast">
Associate the text Loving with the checkbox by nesting only the text Loving in a label element and giving it an appropriate for attribute. -->

<input id="loving" type="checkbox" /> <label for="loving">Loving</label>
