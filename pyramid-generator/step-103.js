// Just like addition, there are different operators you can use for subtraction. The subtraction assignment operator -= subtracts the given value from the current variable value, then assigns the result back to the variable.

// Replace your iterator statement with the correct statement using the subtraction assignment operator

for (let i = count; i > 0; i -= 1) {
  rows.push(padRow(i, count));
