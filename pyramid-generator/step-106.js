// You can actually build the inverted pyramid without needing to loop "backwards" like you did.

// To do this, you'll need to learn a couple of new array methods. Start by using const to declare a numbers variable. Assign it an array with the elements 1, 2, and 3. Then log the numbers array.

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(numbers);
