// Nice work! Experiment with different values for your character, count, and inverted variables.

// When you are ready to move on to your next project, set character to "!", count to 10, and inverted to false to continue.

// Congratulations on completing your first JavaScript project!

const character = "!";
const count = 10;
const rows = [];
let inverted = false;
