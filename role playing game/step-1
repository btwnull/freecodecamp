<!-- JavaScript is a powerful language which allows you to build websites that are interactive.

Note: For all remaining projects in this curriculum, you will need a basic level of knowledge in HTML and CSS. If you are new to HTML and CSS, please go through the Responsive Web Design Certification.

To get started, create your standard HTML boilerplate with a DOCTYPE, html, head, and body, then add a meta tag for the charset. Add a title element and use the text RPG - Dragon Repeller for it. Include a link tag for your stylesheet to link the styles.css file.

Finally, create a div element with id set to game within your body. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>RPG - Dragon Repeller</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <link href="styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="game"></div>
  </body>
</html>
